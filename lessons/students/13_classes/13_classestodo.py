# TODO: Section 1
# Create a class for an Employee, and include basic data
# like first name, last name, age, and title.

# tODO: Section 2

# Create a function inside the class and print out a formatted
# set of strings explaining the details from the employee. Use the f shorthand
# for formatting that was used in the previous example.

# Then, call that function to print out those strings with a class
# of Employee set equal to a variable employeeOne



# Set up a child class that derives from the Employee class and add the attribute 'h_benefits'.
# Define a function 'intro' to print using f shorthand:
# "Hi, my name is [Insert Name here]. I am [age] years old and work as a [Insert job title here]"



# Create a class named 'Animal' with the attributes no_of_legs, weight, height 



# Then you will create 2 classes derived from 'Animal' named 'Mammal' and 'Fish' 
# Define the variable 'habit' for 'Mammal' and 'Fish' to = 'Land' and 'Water' respectively,
# so that it will apply to all Mammals and Fish.
# Also give 'Mammal' a new attribute - 'can_fly' 



# Then set the class 'Dog' derived from 'Mammal' and 'Shark' derived from 'Fish'.
# Give a new attribute to each - 'd_type' and 's_type' respectively.



# Define a function in 'Dog' that prints the statement
# "Golden Retriever: 4 legs, 65 lbs, 47 inches. Habitat: Land"
# Define a function in 'Shark' that prints the statement
# "Great White: 0 legs, 2100 lbs, 144 inches. Habitat: Water"
# Print each statement
